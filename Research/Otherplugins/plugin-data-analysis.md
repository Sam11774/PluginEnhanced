## Advanced Data Collection Patterns Identified

### 1. **Event-Driven Architecture Pattern**
Most plugins use `@Subscribe` annotations for event handling:
- `HitsplatApplied` events for combat tracking
- `ItemContainerChanged` for inventory/bank monitoring  
- `ChatMessage` events for communication analysis
- `WidgetLoaded` for interface state tracking

### 2. **Real-Time Calculation Pattern**
Plugins perform live calculations:
- DPS calculations using damage over time windows
- XP/hour rates using session tracking
- Efficiency metrics using action-to-outcome ratios
- Price calculations using market data APIs

### 3. **State Management Pattern**
Advanced state tracking across game sessions:
- Combat encounter tracking from start to finish
- Activity session management with pause/resume
- Progress tracking with persistent storage
- Goal-oriented data collection

### 4. **Cross-Plugin Data Sharing**
Some plugins share data through common services:
- Party system for group coordination
- Item manager for consistent item data  
- Config manager for user preferences
- Session manager for account linking

### 5. **Performance Optimization Pattern**
Resource-efficient data collection:
- Lazy loading of expensive calculations
- Cached data structures for frequently accessed information
- Async processing for database operations
- Event debouncing for high-frequency updates
